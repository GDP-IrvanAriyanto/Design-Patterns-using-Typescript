## Tipe Design Pattern ##
Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns, Behavioral Patterns etc.

1. Creational Patterns

    >Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

    1. Singleton Pattern

        Definisi: 
        >Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance

        Analogi:
        >Pemerintah adalah contoh dari singleton. Sebuah negara hanya dapat memilii satu pemerintahan. Pemerintah X adalah titik akses global yang mengidentifikasi sekelompok orang yang bertanggung jawab
    
    2. Factory Method 

        Definisi: 
        >Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
    
    3. Abstract Factory

        Definisi:
        >Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    
    4. Builder

        Definisi:
        >Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
    
    5. Prototype

        Definisi:
        >Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

2. Structural Patterns

    >Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

3. Behavioral Patterns

    >Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
